								<h3>My animal-based diet</h3>
								<p>As a former protein enthusiast, I had the mindset that everything "high-protein" is healthy; however, I was compeletly wrong. I used to consume ultra-processed food like protein shakes, chips, and even protein cookies. After doing this habit for months, I discovered the harsh reality of ultra-processed foods. On instagram, many influencers were bringing up the controversy behind seed oils and chemicals in food. With all this in mind, I gradually switched to an animal-based diet which consisted of fruits, raw diary, raw honey, and a variety of meats. With this diet, I not only felt better, but played at my best in tennis. My acne cleared and my cooking skills got better every time. One of the influencers that started me on this journey was Paul Saladino, an animal-based certified board MD.</p>

								<p>Many consider red meat to be cancerous and a carcinogen; I disagree with this. 100% grass red meat contains bioavailable protein and vitamins plus minerals that are essential for the body. Along with this, red meat contains good saturated fat which raises your good cholestral. Remember, there is a HUGE difference between a processed sausage or salami vs a 100% grass-fed steak. Our ancestors have been eating meat a lot in the past along with fruits which occured naturally in nature.  </p>

								<h4>Lifestyle</h4>
								<p>Along with my optimal diet, I consider healthy lifestlye choices along with it. In the modern world, there are many toxins present in and outside of your house. Lets start with polyester: a clothing fabric known to be sprayed with harmful chemicals that irritate the skin and lower testosterone. Another big one is artificial blue light. Blue light occurs when your staring at your phone or computer; this exposes you to artifical blue light. To fix it, I simply turned on a red light feature on my phone which allows me to now feel less tired in the morning. Another one: cooking in non-stick or teflon pans: this practice exposes you to PFOAS or forever chemicals. ANOTHER one: plastic toothbrushes and fluoride toothpaste. Brushes your teeth with microplastics is detrimental to your health due to the oral damage it can cause. Along with the oral damage, fluoride, a known toxin that can damage your teeth in certain areas.  </p>

								<p>There is much more than just these toxins; dishsoap and detergents are known to be cancer-causing items due to their high levels or parabens, phtalates, and fragrances. With all this in mind, I gradually made non-toxic living choices that have allowed me to feel like the best version of myself. Eliminating these toxic items from my daily life also helped me physically and mentally in the long run.</p>

										<h4>My trip to Qatar and Dubai</h4>
										<p>In the winter of 2022 my dad booked tickets to see multiple games of the FIFA World Cup.</p>
									</header>
									<p>Our first stop was Dubai to see our relatives who were flying in from Iran. Our family stayed at the Burj Al-Arab, the only 7 star hotel in the world. Sadly, I got sick in Dubai, but luckily not in Qatar. Qatar was possibly one of the fanciest and most sophisticated places I have ever seen. The stadiums were huge and aesthetic, the hotel rooms were fancy, and the food was superior quality. Our family had the oppurtunity to watch Wales vs Iran, Uruguay vs South Korea, Spain vs Costa Rica, and France vs Australia. In the Wales vs Iran game, Iran scored two late goals to put us ahead and give us hope for the round of 16! It was a dopamine paradise when they scored the late goal and a moment I will never forget. </p>

										<h5>My two different african experiences</h5>
										<p>In early August of 2023, my family took a life-changing trip to the beautiful savannas of Kenya and Tanzania. The trip had us so satisfied we decided to come again to Africa; but to South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique</p>
									</header>
									<p>Our first african safari took place in Serengeti National Park, one of the top rated national parks in Africa. Here we saw the big 5, consisting of lions, leopards, rhinoceros, elephants, and African buffalos. We saw a more unique land structure and savanna in the Masai Mara reserve in Kenya. With the big 5, we thankfully also saw Pumbas, Giraffe, Cheetahs, Baboons, Monkeys, Zebras, Antelope, etc. Since our family was craving these feelings, we decided to revisit this iconic continet for a second time in early June of 2024. We first stopped at Cape Town; then we went to Victoria falls in Zimbabwe, one of the 7 natural wonders of the world. In Zimbabwe, we had the amazing oppurtunity to safari as well. We saw elephant, pumbas, kudus, antelope, etc. After this amazing spot, we returned to the north of South Africa to drive 2 hours up to Kruger National Park. Here we also saw the big 5 along with all the animals that I mentioned in Tanzania and Kenya. The camp that we stayed in Kruger was exeptional: the rooms, the restaurants, the views, and much more! Sadly we had to leave the savana yet again. We headed to Mozambique in an island called Azura Benguerra. This was a beautiful island with crystal clear blue water situated far from the mainland. Like Kruger, the resort was absolutly amazing. Fresh seafood paired with fresh sunshine and the view of the clear blue ocean made this a paradise on earth. We met some locals there who were willing to play soccer on the beach which suprised me. They played like prime Messi and were able to adapt to the tough and hard ball barefoot. Truly an amazing experience from all 5 of the African countries.</p>

										<h5>The Asain Trio</h5>
										<p>In the new year/Christmas break, our family set out the explore Asia. We visited Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam; three dream places that all hold their own unique values.</p>
									</header>
									<p>Our family has visited Asia before; specifically Japan. The culture along with the mouthwatering food encouraged us to return but to more countries. Our first stop was Thailand, which was way more packed with tourists than I would have ever thought. Obviously, the food lived up to the hype; along with the beautifully sculpted temples and buildings. After Bangkok, we set out to the rural beach coast where I did not expect to see any toursits. To my utter suprise again, there were many! I could not beleive my eyes; it was like an average american beach. The blue sunshine water and tropical palm trees made up for all the people present. After Thailand, we went to rural Cambodia to visit a truly iconic natural wonder: Angkor Wat. Known for being the largest religious structure in the world, Angkor Wat attracts many toursits each year. The bulding was built in the ancient city of Khmer as a worship building to the deity Vishnu. Our last stop was Vietnam, a place known for savory Pho and interesting daily life. In Hanoi we explored the food and diet of the people living in this city with a harsh past. Vietnam is the least obese country in the world, so I was geniunly curious. We stayed in Ha long bai for 3 nights and had a lot of amazing views of the rock-island covered lake. Sadly, our last stop was in the city known for bustling night life: Ho Chi Minh. Not much too see here though except for the active midnight nightlife. To sum it up, the blending of these 3 countries' cultures mixed perfectly to leave us with a memory that will last. It was a very enjoyable stay in all 5 cities we visited.  </p>
